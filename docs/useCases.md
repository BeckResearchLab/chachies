Three use cases of our proposed project: 
* 1. Input your own battery cycling data, select and visualize 
representative cycles to get nice plots.
Components: plots, smoothing function, cleaning data functions  
* 2. Look for trends in your own battery cycling data (freedom for user 
to select what trends to look for).  
Components: plots, peak deconvolution and identification, number of 
peaks in a cycle, peak positions, peak widths, peak heights,  
* 3. Input battery cycling data and classify battery as a certain type, 
based off of peak descriptors.
Components: peak deconvolution and identification, number of peaks in a 
cycle, peak positions, peak widths, peak heights (all reused from use 
case #2), ML algorithm.
